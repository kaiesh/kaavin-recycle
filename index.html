    <p>Hi this my recycling website, I hope recycling will be made a lot easier for you after watching some of my videos! Thanks, here's a little bit about me, my name is Kaavin and I'm currently in G5 Of Greenschool, the reason I created this website is for my Greenschool Footprints project, which is a project that happens at the end of primary. You could say it
    's like an end-of-year test. So my footprints project was about enabling people to recycle by creating a website that helps people to recycle and support their understanding of different materials. Did you know that 87% of residents in bali are ready to help make a change?- BaliPartnerShip.org and also that </p>
    <p>There are two features you can use to search for your product, one of them is your normal search bar and the other is a barcode scanner.</p>
